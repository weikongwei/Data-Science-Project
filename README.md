# Data-Science-Project

## Introduction
Scince realestate has become one of the hotest market for investors, people first need to know where to invest in a city. "Location Location Location" is the golden rule of realestate investment. However, if a person is new to the market or new to a city. How would this person know where the best location to possess a property is?

Using City of Chicago as an example, based on the findings from a couple of dataset, it will tell us where the best locations are from the following 4 perspectives.   
   
1. Geographic analysis   
2. Schools and Education   
3. Neighborhood Safety   
4. Convenience (surrounding venues)   

<u>Note:</u> this study doesn't discuss the impact from factors like size of a house, number of rooms of a house, age of a house etc..
   
## Datasets
In this project, we will use three datasets and Foursquare API to gather all data needed.   
   
1. Chicago Census Data: used for human geography analysis. All investors want to purchase an property in a neighborhood which has a relatively high education level and high income level. The census data will help us to find out which areas are good.   
   
2. Chicago Public Schools data: a good school is good for the second generation to grow and study. It would also increase the value of surrounding neighborhoods dromatically. This dataset will help us to find where these neighborhoods are.

3. Chicago Crime Data: simply everyone wants to live in a safe neighborhood. This crime dataset will tell us where the safeties regions are.   
    
4. Foursquare API: this API will help us to explore commercial activities around each neighborhood. Based on the venue types, Machine Learning algorithm would be employeed for neighborhood clustering. Homebuyers could choose neighborhoods based on their personal preferances and life-styles.   

## Analysis

1. Use census data to find neighborhoods with family high income and high education level.  
Optiional: find corolation between these factors on realestate price.  
  
2. Use public school data to find neighborhoods having good schools nearby.  
Optiional: find corolation between this factors on realestate price.  
  
3. Use crime data to find safetiest neighborhoods.  
Optiional: find corolation between this factors on realestate price.  
  
4. Use Foursquare API to find what type of business is the most common around each neighborhoods, for is for homebuyer's personal preference.
